Here I learned and created my own web scraping automation tool to scrape data of jobs every 10 minutes from a certain website. 
Please ensure that you are aware of the ehtical and legal considerations before using such tools. Always check that you are allowed to do so. 
This piece of code is purely created for educational purpose and to teach myself how to perform such a task. Credit to JimshapedCoding from whom I learned the beautifulSoup library
